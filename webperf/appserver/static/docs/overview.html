<h1>Welcome to the Web Performance app for Splunk!</h1>

<h2>About the Web Performance App</h2>

<p>
This Splunk app measures the performance of websites using JavaScript (<a href="https://github.com/yahoo/boomerang" target="_blank">boomerang.js</a>) to beacon <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2012/04/04/measuring-site-speed-with-navigation-timing/" target="_blank">Navigation Timing</a> metrics, including DNS Lookup, Start Render, Doc Ready, and Total Page Load Times, to Splunk via Node.js. This monitoring method, known as Real User Monitoring or RUM, collects performance data from <i>real</i> users in real-time. And unlike synthetic monitoring tools (Gomez/Keynote), can provide valuable insights into how well your website or application is performing under real-world condition. Visit the <a href="/en-US/app/webperf/help">Help</a> section of this app to learn how to get RUM data into Splunk.
